        <h2 class="bold-medium">About the Get information about schools service</h2>
        <p>
            Welcome to the Get information about schools service.
        </p>
        <p>
            This service replaces the previous EduBase system. You can use it to find details about schools, children’s centres, academy trusts and sponsors, and school federations in England. 
            Some information about Welsh establishments is also available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Establishments can also update their records using this service.
