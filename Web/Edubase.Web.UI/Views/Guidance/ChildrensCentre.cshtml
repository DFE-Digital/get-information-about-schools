        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This document sets out the details of children&rsquo;s centres and related group types, as held on &lsquo;Get Information about Schools&rsquo;. You can create, update and download records of children&rsquo;s centres and groups.</p>
        <p>The terms &lsquo;group types&rsquo; and &lsquo;children&rsquo;s centre group&rsquo; refers to the group and collaboration delivery model types used by local authorities (LAs) to support Ofsted in planning the appropriate inspection.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Types of children&rsquo;s centre</h2>
        <p>There are 2 types of children&rsquo;s centre records:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Children&rsquo;s centre</h3>
                <p>Only facilities that fulfil the statutory definition of a children&rsquo;s centre in their own right may be called a children&rsquo;s centre. The children&rsquo;s centre is the &lsquo;main&rsquo; site if it has other &lsquo;linked sites&rsquo; offering access to some of the early childhood services on its behalf.</p>
                <p>A children&rsquo;s centre can be &lsquo;demoted&rsquo; to a linked site if it no longer fulfils the statutory definition of a children's centre in its own right, BUT continues to offer access to some of the early childhood services on behalf of another children's centre. See the definition of linked sites below.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Children&rsquo;s centre linked site</h3>
                <p>These are places open to families and children providing some children's centre services as part of a Sure Start network. In the public domain, the department refers to these as &lsquo;additional sites&rsquo;.</p>
                <p>They were formerly children's centres in their own right and, while they no longer meet the statutory definition of a children&rsquo;s centre, they offer access to some of the early childhood services on behalf of another children's centre.</p>
                <p>A children&rsquo;s centre linked site can be promoted back up to a children&rsquo;s centre if in future it fulfils the statutory definition of a children's centre in its own right.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Types of children&rsquo;s centre groups</h2>
        <p>There are three different types of centres: stand-alone, collaborative and group.</p>
        <p>In &lsquo;Get Information about Schools&rsquo; the collaborative and group types are managed via the &lsquo;Find an establishment group&rsquo; search.</p>
        <p>The definitions of the types are:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Stand-alone</h3>
                <p>This is the default type and these children&rsquo;s centres may work entirely independently of other children&rsquo;s centres. Stand-alone children&rsquo;s centres are inspected alone and have their own Ofsted report.</p>
                <p>Local authorities may change from stand-alone to either collaboration or group status based on the following definitions:</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Children&rsquo;s centre collaboration</h3>
                <p>This is where two or more main children&rsquo;s centres:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>do not share leadership and management</li>
                    <li>share their services through formal or informal arrangements in order to allow families access to a wider range of services than an individual centre can provide</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Wherever possible the inspections of centres sharing this type of arrangement are arranged simultaneously, allowing some evidence and inspector resource to be shared.</p>
                <p>Each main children&rsquo;s centre in a collaboration will have its own inspection report.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Children&rsquo;s centre group</h3>
                <p>This is a group of main children&rsquo;s centres that:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>share leadership and management</li>
                    <li>have integrated services across the centres in the group</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A children&rsquo;s centre group has one inspection and one report that contains assessments for the group as a whole. The report does not contain assessments about the individual main children&rsquo;s centres that make up the group.</p>
                <p>A children&rsquo;s centre group:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>
                        shares leadership and management (for example a group manager or leader or a shared
                        management committee or other shared governance arrangements through a formal
                        agreement), offers integrated or shared services and activities across the main children&rsquo;s
                        centres making up the group
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        must operate in a defined geographical area within one LA and be easily accessible to local
                        families with young children
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Where main children&rsquo;s centres are in a group or collaboration, LAs should continue to list the individual children&rsquo;s centre records on the database, as well as assigning the children&rsquo;s centre to a particular group or collaboration for inspection purposes by using the group function.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Creation of children&rsquo;s centres</h2>
        <p>Members of the Children&rsquo;s Centre Local Authority Data Owners (CCLADO) user group can add new children&rsquo;s centres via the &lsquo;Create a new establishment&rsquo; tool.</p>
        <p>You can only create new children&rsquo;s centres for your own local authority. All fields in the form are mandatory.</p>
        <p>To add a children&rsquo;s centre follow these steps:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Go to the &lsquo;Tools&rsquo; section in the top menu</li>
            <li>Select &lsquo;Create a new establishment&rsquo; (example screenshot below)</li>
            <li>Complete all fields where possible.</li>
            <li>Select &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s centre&rsquo; or &lsquo;Children&rsquo;s centre linked site&rsquo; as the establishment type.</li>
            <li>Select &lsquo;Create</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Editing a children&rsquo;s centre</h2>
        <p>Members of the Children&rsquo;s Centre Local Authority Data Owners (CCLADO) user group can edit and update children&rsquo;s centres within their local authority.</p>
        <p>Children&rsquo;s centre records can be edited in the &lsquo;Details&rsquo; tab (example screenshot below). Select &lsquo;Edit details&rsquo;, make the changes using the relevant field/s, then select &lsquo;Save&rsquo;. As a data owner, the changes will be automatically approved and processed.</p>
        <p>If a change is occurring in the future, you can add a future effective date (for changes that need to be processed immediately, the effective date can be left blank).</p>
        <figure class="gias-figure">

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Converting a children&rsquo;s centre to a linked site (and vice-versa)</h2>
        <p>A children&rsquo;s centre can be converted to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site, and vice-versa.</p>
        <p>Conversion from a children&rsquo;s centre to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site should only be done where it ceases to fulfil the statutory definition of a children's centre in its own right, but that it continues to offer access to some of the early childhood services on behalf of another children's centre.</p>
        <p>You will be asked to confirm that this is the case before you can complete the change.</p>
        <p>It is vice-versa to convert a children&rsquo;s centre linked site to a children&rsquo;s centre: that is the children&rsquo;s centre linked site once again fulfils the statutory definition of a children's centre in its own right, you will be asked to confirm that this is the case before you can complete the change.</p>
        <p>To complete this action, please following these steps:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Remove link to a collaboration or a group</li>
            <li>On the &lsquo;Details&rsquo; tab, select &lsquo;Edit details&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>Change the establishment type from &lsquo;children&rsquo;s centre&rsquo; to &lsquo;children&rsquo;s centre linked site&rsquo; or vice-versa.</li>
            <li>Select &lsquo;Save&rsquo;.</li>
            <li>When converting a children&rsquo;s centre to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site, you must then link it to a children&rsquo;s centre (see Linking children's centres above). A warning will appear if you don&rsquo;t create the link.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The list of fields visible for a children&rsquo;s centre linked site is reduced when compared to a children&rsquo;s centre, this reduction will be applied on saving.</p>
        <p>In a similar fashion, changing a children&rsquo;s centre linked site to a children&rsquo;s centre will result in additional fields being displayed; this will be effective on saving. In this scenario you will need to check and update the &lsquo;re-displayed&rsquo; children&rsquo;s centre information as it is likely to be out of date.</p>
        <p>If the children&rsquo;s centre is in collaboration or a group, before you can convert it to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site you will get a warning message to remove the link to the group first.</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Linking children&rsquo;s centres</h3>
                <p>Children&rsquo;s centre linked site records must have a link to a children&rsquo;s centre.</p>
                <p>Your conversion to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site will be checked overnight and if you have not set up a link to a children&rsquo;s centre the record will be deleted.</p>
                <p>Children&rsquo;s centres with the same type cannot be linked together, so a children&rsquo;s centre linked site cannot be linked to another children&rsquo;s centre linked site or a children&rsquo;s centre linked to another children&rsquo;s centre.</p>
                <p>If you attempt to link two children&rsquo;s centres of the same type, a warning message will appear and you will not be able to save.</p>
                <p>If a children&rsquo;s centre linked site closes the link to the children&rsquo;s centre will be automatically removed.</p>
                <p>If a children&rsquo;s centre is closing and it is linked to a children&rsquo;s centre linked site and you attempt to update the closing record with a close date with the link still in place, you will receive a warning message and you will not be able to save.</p>
                <p>Therefore, if the children&rsquo;s centre linked site is remaining open you must change the link to a different children&rsquo;s centre before you close its current children&rsquo;s centre record.</p>
                <p>To change a linked site from its current children&rsquo;s centre to a different children&rsquo;s centre please follow the steps below:</p>
                <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
                    <li>Open the children&rsquo;s centre linked site record</li>
                    <li>Select the &lsquo;Links&rsquo; tab (example screenshot below)</li>
                    <li>Select &lsquo;Edit&rsquo;</li>
                    <li>Delete the existing link by selecting &lsquo;Edit&rsquo; next to the relevant establishment</li>
                    <li>Add the new link by selecting &lsquo;Add another link&rsquo; and enter the URN of the children&rsquo;s centre</li>
                    <li>Select &lsquo;Save&rsquo;.</li>
                </ul>

        <p>You can create new children&rsquo;s centre groups or collaborations via the &lsquo;Tools&rsquo; link in the menu at the top of the page. The name, type and open date of the group need to be entered.</p>
        <p>To add a new children&rsquo;s centre group:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>In the &lsquo;Tools&rsquo; menu, select &lsquo;Create new children&rsquo;s centres group or collaboration&rsquo; (example screenshot below)</li>

            <li>Enter the group name, the open date and the local authority.</li>
            <li>Add children&rsquo;s centres to the group by entering their URNs and selecting &lsquo;Add&rsquo;. For each centre, add the date it joined the group.</li>

                                <p>Alternatively, all establishments can be removed from the group and the group can be closed</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>When children&rsquo;s centres are removed from a group or collaboration they revert back to being the stand-alone delivery model type.</li>
