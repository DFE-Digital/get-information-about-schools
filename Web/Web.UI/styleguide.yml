# Usage
# %project-path%/hologram style-guide.yml
#
# Hologram will run from same directory where this config file resides
# All paths should be relative to there

global_title: 'Style Guide'

# The directory containing the source files to parse recursively
source: ./Assets/Sass

# The directory that hologram will build to
destination: ./public/assets/styleguide

# footer.html, etc)
# You may put doc related assets here too: images, css, etc.

# If you want to change the way code examples appear in the styleguide,
# modify the files in this folder
# code_example_templates: ./code_example_templates

# The folder that contains custom code example renderers.
# If you want to create additional renderers that are not provided
# by Hologram (i.e. coffeescript renderer, jade renderer, etc)
# place them in this folder
# code_example_renderers: ./code_example_renderers

# Any other asset folders that need to be copied to the destination
# folder. Typically this will include the css that you are trying to
# document. May also include additional folders as needed.

# Mark which category should be the index page
# Alternatively, you may have an index.md in the documentation assets
# folder instead of specifying this config.

# 'section'. To output navigation for sub-sections,
# set the value to `all`

# Hologram displays warnings when there are issues with your docs
# (e.g. if a component's parent is not found, if the _header.html and/or
#  _footer.html files aren't found)
# If you want Hologram to exit on these warnings, set the value to 'true'
# (Default value is 'false')
