        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who we are</h2>
        <p>
            Get Information about School&rsquo;s (GIAS) is a digital service operated by the Department for Education (DfE). As the department&rsquo;s official repository and &lsquo;source of truth&rsquo; for schools and colleges, this service enables users to a) find information about education establishments within England and Wales; and b) allows establishments to update their details. For the purpose of data protection legislation, the DfE is the data controller for the personal data processed as part of GIAS.
        </p>
        <p>
            This privacy policy sets out how we collect and process your personal data for the GIAS digital service. This policy applies to all users of the GIAS digital service (&lsquo;you&rsquo;).
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How we will use your information</h2>
        <p>
            As part of GIAS we receive your personal data from early years and compulsory school age establishments, further and higher education institutions, local authorities and academy trusts. DfE processes your data to compile and maintain the official register of educational establishments in England and Wales for internal use and as a source of reference by the education sector and general public.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">The nature of your personal data we will be using</h2>
        <p>
            We may use the following personal information for GIAS:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>head teachers/principals/managers and governance roles name and contact details</li>
            <li>authorised and public user&rsquo;s internet protocol address (IP)</li>
        </ul>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Why our use of your personal data is lawful</h2>
        <p>
            In order for our use of your personal data to be lawful, we need to meet one (or more) conditions in the data protection legislation. For the purpose of this project, the relevant condition(s) that we are meeting are as set out in Article 6(1)(e) of the UK GPDR in that processing of your information is necessary for the exercise of the function of the department.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Where your data is stored</h2>
        <p>
            The DfE holds and processes personal information within the United Kingdom (UK) and under contracted services, within the European Economic Area (EEA). Where we process your information outside of the UK, we ensure that our service providers take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information in line with our policies and legal requirements.
        </p>


        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How long we will keep your personal data</h2>
        <p>
            We will only keep your personal data for as long as we need it for the purpose(s) of this piece of work, after which point it will be securely destroyed. Please note that, under data protection legislation, and in compliance with the relevant data processing conditions, personal data can be kept for longer periods of time when processed purely for archiving purposes in the public interest, scientific or historical research, and statistical purposes. Non-public personal data is subject to a 6 year retention policy and is then reviewed annually.
        </p>
