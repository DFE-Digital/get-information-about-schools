        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Using this service</h2>
        <p>
            This service is run by the Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service.
            For example, that means you should be able to:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>change colours and contrast</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without any problems</li>
            <li>navigate the service using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate the service using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, Windows Narrator, VoiceOver, Dragon Naturally Speaking and Fusion).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We&apos;ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.
        </p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How accessible this service is</h2>
        <p>Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                users of high contrast mode may find their preferences do not work well with some of the maps and associated features
                as the map tiles and markers retain their original styling
            </li>
            <li>
                whilst navigating via keyboard, toggling between list and map view causes loss of keyboard focus.
                The map markers do not have a visible indication when focused
            </li>
        </ul>
