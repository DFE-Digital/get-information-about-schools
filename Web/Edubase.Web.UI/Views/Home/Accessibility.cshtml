            This service is part of the wider GOV.UK website. There&apos;s a separate accessibility statement for the main GOV.UK website.

        <p>
            This page only contains information about the Get information about schools service, available at

        </p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Using this service</h2>
        <p>This service is run by The Department for Education. We want as many people as possible to be able to use this service.
            For example, that means you should be able to:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>change colours and contrast</li>
            <li>zoom in up to 300% without any problems</li>
            <li>navigate the service using just a keyboard</li>
            <li>navigate the service using speech recognition software</li>
            <li>listen to the service using a screen reader (including the most recent versions of JAWS, Windows Narrator, VoiceOver, Dragon Naturally Speaking and Fusion).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We&apos;ve also made the text in the service as simple as possible to understand.
        </p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">How accessible this service is</h2>
        <p>Some people may find parts of this service difficult to use:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>
                Users of high contrast mode may find their preferences do not work well with some of the maps and associated features
                as the map tiles and markers retain their original styling.
            </li>
            <li>
                Whilst navigating via keyboard, toggling between list and map view causes loss of keyboard focus.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">Technical information about this service&apos;s accessibility</h2>
        <p>
            The Department of Education is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public Sector
            Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.
        </p>
        <p>
            This service is partially compliant with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard.
        </p>


        <h2 class="heading-medium">Non accessible content</h2>
        <p>The content that is not accessible is outlined below with details of:</p>
        <ul class="list-bullet">
            <li>where it fails the success criteria</li>
            <li>planned dates for when issues will be fixed</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some webpages have multiple static elements with the same ID attribute. As a result some users may not be able
            to accurately interpret and parse content. This fails WCAG 2.1A 4.1.1 success criterion (Parsing).
        </p>

        <p>
            There are some instances where a link is not named correctly and does not have the correct role.
        </p>

        <p>
            In addition, this link is more of a collapsed button rather than a link. The element does not have an
            accurate role for users who would expect a link to go to another page rather than expand information.
            These fail WCAG 2.1A 2.4.4 success criterion (Link Purpose (In Context))
            and WCAG2.1A 4.1.2 success criterion (Name, Role, Value).
        </p>

        <p>We plan to address these by November 2020.</p>

        <h2 class="heading-medium">How we tested this service</h2>

        <p>
            The service was last tested on 14 August 2020 and was checked for compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA. The test was carried
            out by the Department of Education Technology Services Accessibility Compliance team.

        <h2 class="heading-medium">What we&apos;re doing to improve accessibility</h2>

        <p>
        We continually review and test our service with users including users of assistive technology. When accessibility
        issues are found we will always prioritise this within our work plans.
