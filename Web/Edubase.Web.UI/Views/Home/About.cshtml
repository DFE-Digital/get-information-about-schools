            Get Information about Schools (GIAS) is the Department for Education&rsquo;s register for several organisation types and where information on other organisations is recorded and maintained.
        </p>

        <p>
            GIAS is used by the department and key partners to contact establishments, update systems, perform analysis and inform policy decisions, some of which carry funding implications.

                    All establishments have a GIAS record that should be kept up to date. Anyone can access the public site, however, to amend the establishment&rsquo;s record and access non-public information the site must be accessed via DfE Sign-in (DSI). Each establishment has a DfE Sign-in approver who should ensure the establishment&rsquo;s record is kept up to date. The approver can assign access to the establishment&rsquo;s record for other establishment colleagues if they need to. For local authority maintained schools, the local authority is also able to access the establishment&rsquo;s record to make amendments, and for academies and free schools multi-academy trusts (MATs).

                <p>
                    All federations and multi-academy trusts (MATs) have a GIAS record that should be kept up to date. Anyone can access the public site, however to amend the records the following process should be taken by these organisations:
                </p>
                <p>
                    Federation records should be accessed via the federation establishment&rsquo;s DfE Sign-in accounts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Multi-academy trust (MAT) records should be accessed via the multi-academy trust DfE Sign-in (DSI) account. Each multi-academy trust has a DSI approver who can assign access to the MAT record for other colleagues if they wish to.
                </p>
                <p>
                    GIAS is the legislative avenue for local authority maintained schools to inform the Secretary of State of changes to their organisation made through the prescribed alterations regulation process:

                    sets out that GIAS must be kept up-to-date.
