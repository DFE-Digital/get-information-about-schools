        <p>
            Welcome to the Get information about schools service.
        </p>
        <p>
            This service replaces the previous EduBase system. You can use it to find details about schools, childrenâ€™s centres, academy trusts and sponsors, and school federations in England.
            Some information about Welsh establishments is also available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Establishments can also update their records using this service.
