        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Testing Scope</h2>
        <p>
            Through completing user journeys and automated testing, the team have completed
            accessibility assurance testing on your service. Testing was completed on 14/08/2020.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Limitations</h3>
        <p>However, the following limitations of our testing must be noted:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>We cannot test the service on every available internet browser; therefore, we cannot guarantee universal compatibility.</li>
            <li>We cannot test the service within every operating system.</li>
            <li>We cannot test the service with every Accessibility software package.</li>
            <li>We cannot provide mobile app accessibility testing.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Testing Standards</h2>
        <p>
            The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (known as WCAG 2.1) are an internationally
            recognised set of recommendations for improving web accessibility. Our team uses these
            standards in testing to help determine a service&rsquo;s level of Accessibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the UK, the Web Accessibility Regulations 2018 stipulate that public websites and mobile
            apps must be WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant. In following with industry best practice and
            globally recognised standards, we will use the WCAG 2.1 AA standards during our testing.
        </p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Devices</h3>
        <p>
            The team completed testing on a variety of devices; including:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>A Macbook (2016) device</li>
            <li>A Microsoft Surface Book (64-bit operating system - DfE Device)</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="govuk-!-font-size-14 govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Please note: We have not tested on a Chromebook.</span></p>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Operating Systems</h3>
        <p>
            The team have tested the following operating systems:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>macOS</li>
            <li>Windows 10</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Accessibility Software</h3>
        <p>
            The team tested using the following:
        </p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>
                <span class="govuk-body-s govuk-!-font-weight-bold">JAWS (2020)</span>
                - a screen reader (text to speech) program developed for users whose
                vision loss prevents them from seeing screen content or navigating with a mouse.
                JAWS provides speech and Braille output for the most popular computer
                applications.

        </ul>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Test Findings</h2>
        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Automated Testing General Findings</h3>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Duplicate ID&rsquo;s Issue</h4>
        <p>
            Your service has multiple instances of duplicate IDs. Without correcting these issues
            user agents, including assistive technologies, may not be able to accurately interpret
            and parse content. If the content cannot be parsed into a data structure, then
            different user agents may present it differently or be completely unable to parse it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html" target="_blank">Success Criterion 4.1.1 Parsing (Level A): (opens in new tab)</a>
            In content implemented using markup
            languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested
            according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and
            any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.
        </p>

        </ul>


        <h3 class="govuk-heading-m">Manual Testing General Findings</h3>
        <h4 class="govuk-heading-s">Link naming Issue </h4>
        <p>
            We have found instances where links within your service&rsquo;s website which are not named
            correctly and do not have the correct role (see image 1.1). We would suggest the name of
            the link is changed to something more meaningful (e.g &ldquo;More information on the data
            available&rdquo;). Screen reader users especially need meaningful link names for when they
            generate a list of links on the page to navigate the content. A link that is simply named &ldquo;more
            information&rdquo; is not helpful in these situations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to that, this link is actually more of a collapsed button rather than a link. Users of
            assistive technology must be able to have an idea of the expected outcome of clicking on an
            element. If the element does not have an accurate role it can be confusing for users who
            expect a link to go to another page rather than expand information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both of these errors mean your service does not meet the stipulations in success criterion
            2.4.4 and 4.1.2 of the Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/navigation-mechanisms-refs.html" target="_blank">2.4.4 Link Purpose (In Context): (opens in new tab)</a>

            The purpose of each link can be determined from the link
            text alone or from the link text together with its programmatically determined link context,
            except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general. (Level A)
        </p>
        <p>

            For all user interface components (including but not limited to: form
            elements, links and components generated by scripts), the name and role can be
            programmatically determined; states, properties, and values that can be set by the user can
            be programmatically set; and notification of changes to these items is available to user
            agents, including assistive technologies. (Level A)

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Overall Findings and Recommendations</h2>
        <p>
            Although generally the service works well for users of assistive technology , it does
            not meet all of the WCAG 2.1 level AA criteria. Therefore, in its current form the
            system is not accessible to users of assistive technology and does not meet WCAG
            2.1 AA Level of compliance. We suggest these issues are added to your
            Accessibility Statement immediately (if you do not have one, you must create one by
            23rd September to comply with regulations) so users are at least aware of them. In
            addition, the issues in the report should be fixed as soon as there is development
            time available.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please review the <span class="govuk-body-s govuk-!-font-weight-bold">Actions to take</span> and, where the decision is made not to take
            these forward, strong evidence should be provided if requested.
