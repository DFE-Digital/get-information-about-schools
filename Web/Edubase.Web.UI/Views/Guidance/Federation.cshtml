        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Introduction</h2>
        <p>This guide sets out the process for creating and editing details of school federations and linking establishments to them.</p>
        <p>To check if your establishment is already part of a federation, see the &rsquo;Federation&lsquo; field of the &rsquo;Details&lsquo; tab. This will display the federation&lsquo;s name as a link to the federation page.</p>
        <p>The actions available on the federation page are.</p>
        <p>If your establishment is not linked to a federation, you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Create a new federation and link your establishment to it</li>
            <li>Link your establishment to an existing federation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>If your establishment is linked to a federation, you can:</p>
        <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
            <li>Edit your federation details, such as federation name and shared headteacher</li>
            <li>Add establishments to your federation</li>
            <li>Remove establishments from your federation</li>
            <li>View federation change history</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Schools should only record federations with a single headteacher; there is no option to add a shared headteacher.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Creating a new federation and linking establishments to it</h2>
        <p>To create a new federation, select &rsquo;Tools&lsquo; in the top menu, then &rsquo;Create new federation&lsquo; in the &rsquo;Create&lsquo; section.</p>
        <p>Enter all the relevant information and add any additional establishments to the federation by selecting &rsquo;Add establishment to the federation&lsquo;.</p>
        <p>A federation must have at least two establishments. You will need the URNs of the other establishments in the federation to add to the record. An establishment&lsquo;s URN can be found by searching for and viewing its record.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Add establishment to a federation</h2>
        <p>To add establishments to your federation, select the &rsquo;Schools&lsquo; tab on your federation page, then the &rsquo;Edit schools&lsquo; button.</p>
        <p>This will open a field for you to enter the URN of the establishment you wish to link with your federation. When the system finds the establishment, add the date it joined the federation.</p>
        <p>You can only link an establishment that is listed as &rsquo;Open&lsquo; or &rsquo;Open but proposed to close&lsquo; to a federation.</p>
        <p>Select &rsquo;Add&lsquo;. This will bring up a confirmation page of the changes you have made when creating the federation. If you&lsquo;re happy with the details of the federation select &rsquo;Submit&lsquo;.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Linking your establishment to an existing federation</h2>
        <p>To link your establishment to an existing federation, select &rsquo;Find an establishment group&lsquo; on the &rsquo;Search&lsquo; page, then search by the federation&lsquo;s name or UID.</p>
        <p>In the &rsquo;Schools&lsquo; tab, select &rsquo;Edit schools&lsquo; and add your school&lsquo;s URN.</p>
        <p>An establishment may only be linked to a single federation. Therefore, you will need to remove your establishment from any federation it is currently linked to, before joining another federation.</p>
        <p>Instructions for how to remove establishments from a federation are in section 6 below.</p>
        <p>If your establishment is not currently linked to a federation, you can select the federation you wish to join. Once you have added the date your establishment joined the federation, select &rsquo;Submit&lsquo;.</p>
        <p>This will bring you to a confirmation page with details of the federation your establishment is joining.</p>
        <p>Once you select confirm it will bring you to your establishment record, showing the federation is now linked to your establishment.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Editing federation details</h2>
        <p>Once linked to a federation, you can edit your federation details. To do this, select your federation on your establishment&lsquo;s &rsquo;Details&lsquo; tab.</p>
        <p>You may then edit fields, add other establishments to the federation (see section 3), and save your changes by selecting &rsquo;Submit&lsquo;.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Removing establishment from the federation</h2>
        <p>To remove establishments from your federation, go to the &rsquo;Schools&lsquo; tab, and select &rsquo;Remove&lsquo; under the school you wish to remove. Once all changes have been made, select &rsquo;Submit&lsquo;.</p>
        <p>A federation must have more than one linked establishment. If you remove all establishments from the federation then it will automatically be closed.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">View federation change history</h2>
        <p>To view the change history of the federation your establishment is linked to, select the &rsquo;Changes&lsquo; tab on the federation page.</p>
